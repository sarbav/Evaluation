# Evaluation Task
Task to submit for evaluation
Hi,

I have submitted my files for evaluation, Here I have done the task by using (MVC) Codeigniter Framework.

All the requirements are filled. They are follows,

There are two pages Add Task and List Task.

In Add Task page, you can add Tasks with priority of low/medium/high. And Validated with form validation.

In List Task page, there is a list contains S.no, Task, Priority, and Options.
In Options, there is Mark as Complete, Edit and Delete Option is placed.
Mark as Complete and Delete options work in Jquery and Ajax.

There is a dropdown to switch between, All Tasks, Completed and Deleted tasks.
